# FormulaCS

This project aims to provide a C# implementation of most Excel formula
functions. An expression parser and evaluator is currently included for the
purpose of testing functions. A secondary objective may be to provide a library
for evaluating Excel workbooks, and perhaps also additional functions.

Anyone wishing to participate in this project should fork and create pull
requests along with appropriate unit tests.
